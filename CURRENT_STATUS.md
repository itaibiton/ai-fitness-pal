# Current Status: Authentication Setup

## âœ… Progress Made
1. **Schema Fixed** - Added required auth tables and made createdAt optional
2. **Auth Functions** - Using proper Actions instead of Mutations  
3. **HTTP Routes** - Convex Auth automatically created http.ts with required routes
4. **File Cleanup** - Removed problematic auth.config.ts file

## ðŸš§ Current Issue
Metro bundler showing "ENOENT" errors when trying to read TypeScript source files from @convex-dev/auth package. This is likely a source map/debugging issue, not a runtime problem.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. **Set Environment Variables** in Convex Dashboard:
   - `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` (generate with OpenSSL or setup command)
   - `SITE_URL` (e.g., http://localhost:8081)

2. **Restart Metro** with cache clear:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Test Authentication** - The core setup should now work once env vars are set

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup Commands
```bash
# Generate JWT key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private-key.pem -pkcs8 -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Or use Convex Auth setup
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

The Metro errors are likely cosmetic - the auth functionality should work once environment variables are configured!
